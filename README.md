# "HTML Project for Beginners"

✅ [Check out my YouTube Channel with all of my tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/DaveGrayTeachesCode).

This repository shares the starter code for the [YouTube Tutorial](https://youtu.be/T5PD8ofhiug). 

**Your Challenge:** Utilize the knowledge you have gained from the [HTML for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0Zuz27SZ-6OlAwitnFUubtE93DO-l0vu) tutorial series to build a website for The Little Taco Shop. 

**Directions:**

- There are images of the 3 web pages you need to build in the examples folder. Use them as references for what you build.

- You should name your files: index.html, hours.html, and contact.html

- There is minimal CSS already available in css/styles.css. You need to link that file to your HTML files. 

- All images are provided in the img folder.

- If you need to find taco emojis, try [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/taco/). 

- A favicon is already included. You'll need to add it in the head section of each page.

## 🚀 My Implementation

This project is my personal implementation of the **Little Taco Shop** website as part of my HTML learning journey.

### Pages Implemented
- **Home** (`index_p.html`)
- **Store Hours** (`hours.html`)
- **Contact Us** (`contact.html`)

### Features
- Semantic HTML structure (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `footer`)
- Navigation across multiple pages
- Section linking using `id` and anchor links (`#`)
- HTML form with validation attributes
- Images and favicon integration

## 📚 What I Learned

- Difference between favicon and images used inside the page
- Relative paths vs root paths
- Linking sections across different HTML pages
- Use of form attributes like `required`, `autocomplete`, and `formtarget`
- Basic Git and GitHub workflow using VS Code terminal
